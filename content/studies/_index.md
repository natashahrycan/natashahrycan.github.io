Here you can find summaries I prepare for my courses in the master's program of Computing Modeling and Simulation at TU Dresden. I also share my experiences as a uni student, hoping it may reach other students and make them feel more understood. Lastly, I will write about things I find interesting like books, podcasts, websites, you name it!
