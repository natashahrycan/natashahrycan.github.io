As mentioned in my bio, I am currently working at ScaDS.AI and the Max Planck Insitute for Mathematics in the Sciences in projects related to education and computer sciences, trying to build a bridge towards new knowledge for those interested in topology, geometry, programming, AI and ML. Here I will be sharing descriptions of the projects I am working on. If you would like to collaborate with our projects, feel free to contact me!
