Welcome to my website! Here I share posts related to my student life and work projects, as well as study materials that I develop for my classes.

I am a master's student at TU Dresden in the program of Computer Modeling and Simulation, holding a scholarship from the School of Embedded Composite Artificial Intelligence (SECAI). This summer I graduated as a physicist from Universität Leipzig. I finished my bachelor thesis at the Leibniz Institute of Surface Engineering (IOM) in Leipzig, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Andre Anders and Dr. Stefan Zahn. My work compared models of AI algorithms for object detection in experimental physics, testing on images generated in experiments at IOM in the last 10 years. 

At the moment I am an affiliated member of the Max Planck Institute of Mathematics in the Sciences in Germany (MPI MIS) at the group of Stochastic Topology and its Applications, leaded by Dr. Erika Roldan. I am also working at the Center for Scalable Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence (ScaDS.AI) in the Department of Statistical Learning, where we are developing projects that will make it easier for anyone interested to get more acquainted with applications of AI and research in topology and geometry.
