As mentioned in my bio, I work at ScaDS.AI and the MPI MIS in Leipzig, both are inspiring places with really interesting people that fuel my energy for meaningful projects. Here I will also share about research I am working on, and tell you more about the experience a bit more personally than one would do in a paper ;) Do not hesitate to contact me for collaborations or suggestions about these topics!
