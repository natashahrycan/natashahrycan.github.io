Here I share posts related to my student life and work projects, as well as study materials that I develop for my classes.\nI am a soon-to-be physicist at Universität Leipzig (according to rigurous calculations of one of my colleagues, I am 93% of a phisicist). I am in the last stages of finishing my bachelor thesis at the Leibniz Institute of Surface Engineering (IOM) in Leipzig, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Anders and Dr. Stefan Zahn. My work compares models of AI algorithms for object detection in experimental physics, using as a test the images generated in the experiments conducted by Dr. Ulrike Helmstedt. After finishing my bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degree, I will be moving to Dresden to continue in the master\u0026rsquo;s program of Computer Modeling and Simulation at TU Dresden.\nAt the moment I am an affiliated member of the Max Planck Institute of Mathematics in the Sciences in Germany (MPI MIS) at the group of Stochastic Topology and its Applications, leaded by Erika Roldan. I am also working at the Center for Scalable Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence (ScaDS.AI) in the Department of Statistical Learning, where we are developing projects that will make it easier for anyone interested to get more acquainted with applications of AI and research in topology and geometry.\nWhat type of coffee does she drink to have this much energy always?\n—My classmates\nNot a single year in the National Maths Olympiads where she went to sleep ealy before the exam, yet she won medals every single year.\n—My school Maths teacher\nDon't believe her \"short easy Sunday morning\" runs, you'll thank me later.\n—My unfit friend\n*sights*\n—My mom and siblings\n","date":"24 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"","summary":"Outstanding woman, not only because of her height.","title":"","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"24 July 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/study_posts/","section":"Study_posts","summary":"","title":"Study_posts","type":"study_posts"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
