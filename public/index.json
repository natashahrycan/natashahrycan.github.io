Here I share posts related to my student life and work projects, as well as study materials that I develop for my classes.\nI am a freshly graduated physicist from Universität Leipzig. I finished my bachelor thesis at the Leibniz Institute of Surface Engineering (IOM) in Leipzig, under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Andre Anders and Dr. Stefan Zahn. My work compared models of AI algorithms for object detection in experimental physics, testing on images generated in experiments at IOM in the last 10 years. I will soon be moving to Dresden to continue in the master\u0026rsquo;s program of Computer Modeling and Simulation at TU Dresden.\nAt the moment I am an affiliated member of the Max Planck Institute of Mathematics in the Sciences in Germany (MPI MIS) at the group of Stochastic Topology and its Applications, leaded by Erika Roldan. I am also working at the Center for Scalable Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence (ScaDS.AI) in the Department of Statistical Learning, where we are developing projects that will make it easier for anyone interested to get more acquainted with applications of AI and research in topology and geometry.\nWhat type of coffee does she drink to have this much energy always?\n—My classmates\nNot a single year in the National Maths Olympiads where she went to sleep early before the exam, yet she won medals, can't complain much.\n—My school Maths teacher\nDon't believe her \"short easy Sunday morning\" runs, you'll thank me later.\n—My unfit friend\n*sighs*\n—My mom and siblings\n","date":"2 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"","summary":"Outstanding woman, not only because of her height.","title":"","type":"page"},{"content":"A space where I share a bit of my life besides work and study.

Classic amateur enthusiasm and very typical of me. Not that it\u0026rsquo;s bad, as long as it is safe for you and everyone else close to you, why not? Lately, my reckless ideas have started coming back and I love it. The reason why many friends have been telling me \u0026ldquo;I cannot understand how you can be so smart and so stupid at the same time\u0026rdquo; along the years is exactly because of things like this, and I consider these reckless plans part of my identity.\nAnyways, back to the triathlon, let\u0026rsquo;s give you some context on my experience with all those disciplines. Swimming is the one I was the least experienced in, so my goal was just to complete the distance, regardless of the time. With cycling I was pretty confident, in 2022 I did a solo 3-day trip covering 90 km (another reckless idea if you wonder) and it went fine, so I guessed that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be an issue. Running is the discipline I have the most experience with, I started consistently running one and a half year ago and my performance has improved dramatically.\nThis is for those who think they cannot run: before actually started running as I do now, I tried at least in 5 different seasons and failed to keep up in all of them. Notice that I didn\u0026rsquo;t say fail to run, but rather fail to keep up. This is because you literally cannot fail to run! You may need to go slower, take more breaks, run only 500 m today because you don\u0026rsquo;t feel well. The only thing you can fail at is not showing up to run, at least once a week (unless you got a serious injury or need rest). That is failing the hope you put in yourself when you said some weeks ago that you would start running for reals. In case you fail, try again and again and again! I did the same and last year I decided it was enough of lying to myself, I locked in and I started to show up for myself, regardless of the distance or speed. After some months you will start to notice the differences and you will be so glad you didn\u0026rsquo;t stop, good luck chuck!\nOnce again, back to the triathlon. So I told my partner \u0026ldquo;Hey, I wanna do a triathlon this summer, I\u0026rsquo;m already searching for some options in Germany\u0026rdquo; and after some debate around how I would probably need more months to train (which I agree on, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t care about a fantastic performance, I was curious about if I could complete it), he suggested we could choose a triathlon route ourselves and save at least 100 euros. Fantastic idea, I just wanted to show myself that I can complete a triathlon, so a DIY triathlon has everything I needed.\nSo he took over the route planning and I focused on training. As I am not a big fan of long distance races, the idea was to complete a Super Sprint: 400 m of swimming, 10 km of cycling and 2,5 km of running. Running that distance was easy peasy, cycling that distance would probably leave me short of breathe but okay, and with the swimming I definitely needed to put on some work. I was training at the Cospudener See close to Leipzig, but it was difficult to know the distance as Garmin loses GPS signal when it\u0026rsquo;s underwater. Also, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t go to the lake everyday because I had tons of work to do with my thesis, so it was a difficult time to organize my thesis, one exam, my work, strength and triathlon training.\nTriathlon day! # We were in Bergen (Norway) for our DIY triathlon but as usual, the weather in Bergen had been rainy and windy for several days. That could be a problem for the swimming section, as the lake was above in the mountains and the water would be close to 10°, which is definitely not warm. We always follow the golden rule, dear readers, safety first. I am not an experienced swimmer in open water, I do not have a wetsuit and I do not know how my body will react to stress + cold water, so I let my ego go and decided that if necessary, the swimming distance will be shorter. Now let me tell you a quick summary of each section:\nSwimming: the weather was slightly better (only showers and eventually there would be sun according to the forecast), but the water was still pretty cold. Following the golden rule, I decided to shorten the swimming section to 100 m, as I was getting nervous in the water because of the cold and the stress of the triathlon. This is another aspect I love about sports, how they can be an exercise for mental strength and pushing yourself to do things. As I mentioned, the swim was short so after getting back to land I just went running to dry myself and start with the longest section, cycling.\nCycling: remember how I said that I was pretty confident with cycling? Well, I just have to say: never underestimate when a Scandinavian tells you that the path goes only uphill. When he told me that, I assumed that for most of it, it could go uphill, but it can\u0026rsquo;t be that bad right? Needless to say I was absolutely wrong: the path went basically upwards all the time and I was too tired to even think about changing gears. Exhausting is a really light word to describe what the cycling stage was, it was a constant battle in my head, telling myself I can get to the finish line and avoiding to watch my watch, realizing I only did 3 km and I still had 7 to go. This is another reason why I wanted to do this triathlon, figure out my weaknesses to start working on them for next summer. So, even though I was breathless by the end, I did 10 km cycling up a mountain, how insane is that! One year ago I would have never believed it! Now I know I can do it and I know I have to put more effort on it for next season.\nRunning: so after that cycling stage I was definitely struggling to walk, it took me a couple of minutes to get my legs working properly again. This stage allowed me to enjoy more the views, as I am more used to pushing myself while running, so it has become much easier. One funny thing is that in steep sections, I was faster running that when I was cycling, which I\u0026rsquo;m really proud of, considering how much I have been running in the last year. I thought at first it was 5 km so I was saving some energy, when my partner reminded me it was only 2,5 km I went sprinting and completed 3 km. That last thing was due to a misunderstanding, he was going to wait at the finish line and he went too far, so I run a bit extra for those meters that I didn\u0026rsquo;t swim.\nCool-down hike: not that much of a cool-down but we continued going up the mountain for 8 km, and I have to say it was completely worth it. The mountain had beautiful waterfalls and crystal clear water running through it, together with the characteristic summer-green shade of nature in the Norwegian mountains, it was mesmerizing. Here you can see a bit of all the wonders we saw that day, it\u0026rsquo;s a pity that the camera cannot capture perfectly how beautiful the landscape was.\nNow the actual cool-down: enjoying the views in a more relaxing way on the way back (with a beautiful weather, the sun came out after the triathlon was finished), going to a petrol station to get some burgers and getting back to the house to drink some tea and not move anymore. The next day the pain wasn\u0026rsquo;t that bad, I wonder if it\u0026rsquo;s because of a 12 km hike in Hovden we had days before, maybe that was more challenging? Maybe I didn\u0026rsquo;t push myself enough? Maybe my fears were blocking my full physical potential? I think it\u0026rsquo;s a mixture of all of those options, so it\u0026rsquo;s good to know what I have to work on for next year.\nExtra surprise: Northern lights! Seeing Northern lights in Bergen with the naked eye is difficult due to 2 reasons: it\u0026rsquo;s not that close to the North and it is always cloudy. I was already in bed and exhausted, but my partner told me to go outside and we realized that those were not clouds, they were indeed some really nice green and pink Northern lights! It felt absolutely magical, I felt like in the movie \u0026ldquo;Brother Bear\u0026rdquo; (well they were not moving that fast or intensely, but it was definitely a lot given the location of Bergen). They were moving quicker than I thought they could, but still there are some nice shots of them. Eventually the clouds arrived and the show was over, so here you can enjoy some of the pictures of that night :D\nHere is a closer look, the colors were noticeable with the naked eye but not as intense as in the photographs.\n","date":"2 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about_me/first_triathlon/","section":"About me","summary":"My experience in my first mountain triathlon in Norway","title":"My first triathlon!","type":"about_me"},{"content":"","date":"2 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/sports/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Sports","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"2 September 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"Hey there!

As you already know (or will soon know), dear reader, the process of writing a thesis can be long and tedious, and I share your suffering. If you are in the process (or will soon be) of writing your thesis, I would like to share some wisdom on things that helped me go through it.\nTake these suggestions with a grain of salt, we are all different and if these tips don\u0026rsquo;t work for you, it\u0026rsquo;s just because something else fits you better! Take it easy friend, now let\u0026rsquo;s dig in.\nPlan your work ahead # Listen, you and I both know that after waking up the last thing you have is a clear mind to remember everything you did yesterday and what you need to do today. Don\u0026rsquo;t lie to yourself, that will save you lots of time. At the end of your working day, take a piece of paper, a post-it, a notebook, your tablet, whatever, but don\u0026rsquo;t rely solely on your memory. Remember that as you approach the deadline, you will have more things to do in your head and using it as an agenda is just, well, as inefficient as it could be. Thankfully paper was invented a long time ago, so go and use it.\n\u0026ldquo;I have the paper, but what do I write on it?\u0026rdquo; Well, my dear reader, there are two things you can write about: what was done today and what needs to be done tomorrow. Write what bugs you fixed today, what papers you reviewed and what things didn\u0026rsquo;t work, that way you avoid repeating mistakes and doing useless work. Plan ahead what you need to do tomorrow based on the errors you had today, include what things you could try (you will forget about which paper you needed to look at tomorrow, just write it down) or what sections you would like to write.\nFor your own sake, be reasonable on the amount of work you expect to do tomorrow. If you prioritize being honest with yourself and realize how much time it takes to do certain tasks, this tool will come in handy. Otherwise, you may risk setting yourself in a position with too much self criticism, not necessarily constructive. It can be difficult, but I trust you will find your way around, push through a little bit more, dear reader. Writing about what I did today helped me realize many times that I did a good amount of work, when in my head I thought I did basically nothing that day. Writing about tomorrow allowed me to go straight to my desk and start working instead of wandering around my head, trying to remember what I was planning to do.\nAsk for help # This is probably one of the points I struggled with the most. At some point, a really dear person to me was repeating this several times a day because I would get stuck in my code for weeks, thinking I could figure it out. Sometimes maybe I did, and many other times I did not. Is it a good opportunity for self-learning? Absolutely! But let me tell you something, dear reader: you got a deadline! That deadline does not care about your pride and that you are an independent strong student, that\u0026rsquo;s just the reality.\nIf you do not have a deadline, I\u0026rsquo;m happy for you and consider yourself lucky. Most likely most people reading this are months (or weeks, hopefully not days) away from having to send the final version of their thesis. If you get stuck, be reasonable on the amount of time you plan on using to solve this problem.\nLet me give you an example: while working with my thesis, I got stuck on an error message for about 10 days. I was very adamant and refused to send an e-mail to my supervisor. I don\u0026rsquo;t remember exactly, but I think I had to let my stubbornness aside and ask for help. Weeks prior to my deadline, I realized that if I had a bit more of time (for example, 10 days, I wonder where could I get 10 more days!) I would have been able to train my object detection model with better parameters, or even add another architecture for testing. What was more important, solving that bug by myself or adding more useful information to my thesis? I hope we all agree that the second option. Take a couple of days to solve it by yourself and if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, go and ask your supervisors for help, that\u0026rsquo;s literally their job! If you want to challenge yourself and spend lots of time solving problems by yourself, there\u0026rsquo;s a perfect position that would even pay for you to do that. It\u0026rsquo;s called doing a PhD! Good luck with it and let me know how it goes XD\nTake breaks # This may be a tough one for many, myself included. Depending on your mood and situation, taking breaks in between study/work sessions can help you keep focused along the day. The idea was presented to me when reading the book \u0026ldquo;When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing\u0026rdquo;, from Daniel H. Pink. I will not go on detail about the book, all I can say is that it has more than a couple of interesting facts about chrono-biology and how we can use it to make the most out of our day. The most important advice that I took from that book was avoiding long study sessions, as time passes our focus may start vanishing and we end up being less productive.\nOn the other hand, I know some of my friends here reading this have hyper-focus periods when they can get going for hours and hours without noticing. This tip is not for them (unless they want to), is for the other half that struggles a bit more to focus and complete our tasks for the day.\nI would schedule short breaks with a Pomodoro timer (25/5 or 50/10, depending on the mood and energy) and then take a longer break around midday and/or the evening. That longer break would usually be: going to the gym, do my laundry, run some errands in the city, doing crochet, buy my groceries, cook and eat, go for a walk, etc. Get out of your desk and move your body, avoid sitting and looking at Reddit or other social media. Using your phone is not resting, and if you think it is, you\u0026rsquo;re just fooling yourself. That will not help your brain get any rest. It may not be what you want to read, but it is what you need.\nHydrate yourself # Yes, I know you are drinking extra coffee and energy drinks during this time. Your poor organs don\u0026rsquo;t have the fault you\u0026rsquo;re trying to graduate. Respect your body as the temple it is. If your body is not functioning properly, how are you expecting that your brain will work at its fullest? Once again, don\u0026rsquo;t fool yourself! That\u0026rsquo;s just auto-sabotage, and you\u0026rsquo;re the one that will pay the consequences of your own actions.\nTip: Drinking enough water in the morning before starting with your coffee may save you some headaches. Dear reader, your body naturally craves water. First thing you do in the morning is go and shove in a whole cup of coffee, and you\u0026rsquo;re still wondering why you need a paracetamol to get through the day? Put a sticker with a smiley face in your calendar every time you drink water before caffeine if that helps, but go and drink water for your own sake! Do not underestimate the importance of a healthy body for a healthy mind.\n","date":"30 August 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/studies/student_life/tips_thesis_writing/","section":"Studies","summary":"A couple of things I have learned while writing my bachelor thesis","title":"Tips for thesis writers","type":"studies"},{"content":"As mentioned in my bio, I work at ScaDS.AI and the MPI MIS in Leipzig, both are inspiring places with really interesting people that fuel my energy for meaningful projects.
